Precision medicine is progressively becoming a hot topic in all disciplines related to biomedical investigation and has the capacity to become the para - digm for clinical practice. The future of medicine lies in early diagnosis and individually appropriate treatments, a concept that has been named precision medicine, i.e. delivering the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. Molecular imaging is quickly being recognized as a tool with the potential to ameliorate every aspect of cancer treatment. On the other hand, emerging high-throughput technologies such as omics techniques and systems ap - proaches have generated a paradigm shift for biological systems in advanced life science research. In this review, we describe the precision medicine, difference between precision medicine and personalized medicine, precision medicine initiative, systems biology/medicine approaches (such as genomics, radiogenomics, transcriptomics, pro - teomics, and metabolomics), P4 medicine, relationship between systems biology/medicine approaches and preci - sion medicine, and molecular imaging modalities and their utility in cancer treatment and diagnosis. Accordingly, the precision medicine and molecular imaging will enable us to accelerate and improve cancer management in future medicine. Keywords: Precision medicine, molecular imaging, precision medicine initiative, systems biology, metabolomics- based systems medicine, cancer theranostics, radio-omics, P4 medicine Introduction President Obama announced in his State of the Union Address on January 20, 2015, “I’m launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes -and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep our - selves and our families healthier” [1, 2]. Now the President has declared a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new age of precision medicine . Precision (or per - sonalized) medicine is being strongly supported as a solution to selectively target cancer cells and minimize damage to normal tissue . The goal of this initiative is to acquire momentum of precision medicine . It also aims to identify diagnostic and treatment models whose cen - tral focus is on the individual variability of dis - ease presentation . As an inestimable tool in precision medicine, theranostics, which is a portmanteau term of “therapeutics” and “diag - nostics”, was coined by John Funkhouser in 2002. It can be defined as a diagnostic method - ology for individually tailored therapeutic inter - vention, and it personalizes healthcare practic - es to an individual patient by removing inessen - tial treatments for whom a standard therapy is not suitable and/or by optimizing a therapeutic plan for a particular patient . The rapid Precision medicine and molecular imaging 311 Am J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 2016;6:310-327growth of precision medicine requires dedicat - ed future leaders with a strong foundation in advanced genomic medicine, including mo- lecular diagnostic techniques such as next generation sequencing and whole genome/ exome sequencing interpretation. These lead - ers should integrate personalized medicine into healthcare, and they must attain many addi - tional management and teaching skills . The electronic medical records (EMRs) and genom - ic research effort work to advance personalized and precision medicine. In fact, the eMERGE network launched in 2007 is an NIH-funded consortium devoted to genomic discovery and implementation investigation by leveraging bio - repositories connected to EMRs . The preci - sion medicine requires information technology (IT) infrastructure for the storage, maintenance, and transfer of large amounts of individual genomic data. With such a biobank IT, the researchers enable the management of genetic data for individual patients and other research . The largest precision medicine project in Germany was launched in 2013, entitled the German National Cohort (GNC). This project is a nationwide, long-term study with an overall duration of 25-30 years and a €210 million budget for the first 10 years. Despite these projects, precision medicine in Germany is still signi ficantly smaller than in the United States . Molecular imaging is quickly acquiring recogni - tion as a tool that has the capacity to improve every aspect of cancer treatments. Molecular imaging in oncology has been described as in vivo characterization and the measurement of key biomolecules and molecularly based events that are fundamental to the malignant state . While molecular imaging is defined by the Society of Nuclear Medicine as the “visualiza - tion, characterization, and measurement of bio - logical processes at the molecular and cellular levels in humans and other living systems” , the burgeoning demand among physicians, patients, and communities for personalized care is increasing the importance of molecular imaging and forming the development of bio - medical imaging as a whole . Molecular imaging is developing to include a variety of imaging techniques to enable in vivo monitor - ing of cellular and molecular processes . Although molecular imaging has existed for decades, the rapid progress of molecular and cell biology, imaging technology, and imaging probe evolvement have highly raised its power and potential. Essential to the development and translation of molecular imaging is interdis - ciplinary collaboration across many fields, including radiology, nuclear medicine, pharma - cology, chemistry, molecular and cell biology, physics, mathematics, and engineering. In fact, these include positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed to- mography (SPECT), computed tomography (CT), MRI, MRSI, ultrasound, and optical imaging . Hence, imaging techniques and system biology approaches can be applied as two high- throughput methods to cancer therapy and diagnosis in clinical experiments. Cancer is one of the widespread causes of death all over the world. Cancer research has focused on the identification of molecular dif - ferences between cancerous and healthy cells . There is much evidence that the interac - tion and network between genes and proteins plays an important role in the research of can - cer molecular mechanisms. It is essential and significant to present a new initiative of preci - sion medicine in cancer investigation by inte - grating systems biology, clinical science, omics technology, bioinformatics, and mathematical science to improve diagnosis, therapies, and prognosis of diseases . Cancer is disease established on the malfunction of system char - acteristics in biology. Therefore, it has been recognized as a systems biology disease . Advances in science and technology have pro - vided approaches toward the diagnosis, thera - pies, and prognosis of cancer such as molecu - lar imaging and systems biology as new target - ed methods in clinical science. Systems biology has appeared during the two recent decades as a powerful new pattern for investigation in life science . Our understanding of cancer initiation and progress has been furthered by means of high-throughput discovery technolo - gies, such as next generation sequencing and the core omics including genomics, radi - ogenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics . Indeed, those are systems biology approaches for better comprehending of cancer systems biology. This review’s pur - pose is to highlight the role and importance of precision medicine and molecular imaging technologies accompanying systems biology/ medicine approaches to cancer therapeutics Precision medicine and molecular imaging 312 Am J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 2016;6:310-327and diagnosis to create new targeted approach - es in future medicine. Precision medicine According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), precision medicine is “an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle for each per - son” [2, 16, 17]. This approach will permit phy - sicians and investigators to predict more pre - cisely which treatment and prevention strate - gies for a special disease will work in which groups of people. It is in conflict to a “one-size- fits-all” approach in which disease treatment and prevention strategies are developed for the average person, with less consideration for the differences between individuals. Although the term “precision medicine” is relatively new, the concept has been a part of healthcare for many years. For instance, a person who requires a blood transfusion is not given blood from a ran - domly selected donor; instead, the donor’s blood type is matched to the recipient to decrease the risk of complications [1, 2]. Although examples can be found in several areas of medicine, the role of precision medi - cine in day-to-day healthcare is relatively limit - ed. Scientists hope that this approach will expand to many areas of health in the coming years . Indeed, precision medicine is now widely utilized only in oncology , particularly for treatment the of melanoma, metastatic lung, breast, and brain cancer and leukemia . Radioiodine theranostics is a typical example of precision medicine and has been utilized widely for the management of differen - tiated thyroid cancer . Generally, precision medicine has not yet become a medical stan - dard for many conditions in spite of its high expectations in the United States, Germany, and other countries . Difference between precision medicine and personalized medicine Between the terms “precision medicine” and “personalized medicine”, there is a lot of over - lap. According to the National Research Council (United States), “personalized medicine” is an older term with a meaning similar to “precision medicine”. There was concern that the term “personalized” could be misconceived to imply that treatments and preventions are being advanced uniquely for each individual; in preci - sion medicine, the focus is on identifying which approaches will be effective for which patients based on genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors [2, 9, 19]. The Council therefore pre - ferred the term “precision medicine” to “per - sonalized medicine”. However, some people still utilize the two terms interchangeably . Precision medicine initiative In early 2015, President Obama announced a strong conviction that science and investiga - tion offer great potential for focusing on bring - ing precision medicine to many facets of health - care [1, 9, 20]. The President’s budget for fiscal year 2016 comprised of $216 million in funding for the initiatives of the NIH, the National Cancer Institute (NCI, the NIH institute focused on cancer research), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . The Precision Medicine Initiative has both short-term and long-term purposes. The short-term objectives include enlarging precision medicine in the field of can - cer research. Investigators at the NCI hope to utilize this approach to find novel, more effec - tive cares for different types of cancer based on increased knowledge of the biology and genetics of the disease. The long-term objec - tives of the Precision Medicine Initiative focus on bringing precision medicine to all aspects of health and healthcare on a large scale as well as generate knowledge applicable to the whole range of health and disease . For this goal, the NIH schemes to start a study including a group (cohort) of at least one million volunteers from around the United States. Participants will provide genetic data, biological samples, life - style, environment, and other information about their health. This data will be utilized by investigators to examine a large range of dis - eases, with the aims of better predicting dis - ease risk, comprehending how diseases hap - pen, and finding improved diagnosis and treat - ment strategies . Systems biology as an efficient tool in preci - sion medicine The expression “systems biology” has appeared during recent years to explain the frontier of interdisciplinary investigations in biology . The modern biology is supported by the prog - ress in high-throughput experimental tech - niques such as genomics, transcriptomics, pro - Precision medicine and molecular imaging 313 Am J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 2016;6:310-327teomics, metabolomics, phenomics, and other omics technologies that may generate “big data science”. Systems biology has been described as the study of biological compo - nents and their interactions using models and/ or networks to integrate genes, metabolites, proteins, regulatory elements and other bio- logical components via high-throughput tech - nologies such as DNA-microarray, Fluorescen- ce microscopy, Illumina sequencer, GC-MS, LC-MS, MALDI-TOF, HPLC, FT-IR, mass spec - trometry, HPLC-MS, NMR, and so on [22, 23]. Through systems biology, we can find out more puzzling images regarding the fundamental components of biology including the genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, mem - brane systems, organelles [24, 25]. The big data biology, network biology, and other new branches of modern biology have emerged as a result of the combination of versatile knowl - edge ( Figure 1 ). For instance, understanding of systems-level of the cell or cellular components and subprocesses will be facilitated by network biology. The aim of systems biology is to com - Figure 1. A general hierarchi - cal diagram of the systems biology approaches integrated to the molecular imaging tech - niques toward diagnosis and prognosis a typical cancer disease. Precision medicine and molecular imaging 314 Am J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 2016;6:310-327prehend the functions and mechanisms in the different levels of organisms or cells . Today, systems biology is encountering the challenges of analyzing huge biological net - works and big molecular biological data. Systems approaches It is necessary to integrate experimental and computational research in order to understand complex biological systems. In other words, it is a systems biology approach . Nowadays, the holistic systems biology approaches have created a new outlook in biology, medicine, and pharmacological sciences [28, 29]. Systems biology has provided the base for encoding the structure, variation, and function of the human genome and relating them to health and dis - ease states by high-throughput technologies for DNA sequencing and for analyses of tran - scriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes . Many biological processes have already applied omics approaches to lead a large num - ber of genes potentially included in correspond - ing modules. Development and implementa - tion of computational methods was an impor - tant step of progress by which genes or proteins that conduct similarly under different experi - mental situations . In this section, we dis - cuss on the principal “omics” techniques including genomics, transcriptomics, pro - teomics, and metabolomics as the most fre - quently approaches applied in systems medi - cine research. An overview of the omics tech - nologies for systems medicine and precision medicine has also been presented ( Table 1 ). Genomics and transcriptomics Evolution in high-throughput technologies has produced a paradigm shift for biological sys - tems in advanced life science investigations. The systems biology by means of methodically organizing the genomics, functional genomics, and proteomics data attempts to provide a sys - tems-level comprehension of the biological phenomena . In 1986, the term “genomics” was coined by Thomas Roderick for first time. Genomics expression was quickly applied as the novel journal name intended to sustain the new areas and discipline of genome mapping and sequencing [21, 32]. Indeed, this was a big and fantastic transformation in molecular biol - ogy through the evolution of dramatically effi - cient approaches for DNA sequencing . Genomics is the branch of science that studies the genome, or the genetic material or blue print of a plant, animal, human, microorgan - isms, and/or other species in order to under - stand the functions, gene interactions, and regulation of gene networks with each other and the environment . Nevertheless, the focus of genomics research is mostly on the investigation of sequencing (sequence genom - ics), functions (functional genomics), struc - tures, and interactions of genes. An example of a huge international genomics project was the Human Genome Project that was successfully completed in 2003 . One of the first omics technologies that had thereafter developed was transcriptomics . Transcriptomics is defined as the study of transcriptome under particular circumstances or in a certain cell by high-throughput technologies such as RNA-seq and microarray analysis . The most impor - tant purposes of transcriptomics are: to make an itemized list of all species’ transcripts, including mRNAs, non-coding RNAs, and small RNAs; to appoint the transcriptional structure of genes in terms of their beginning sites, 5 ’ and 3 ’ ends, splicing models, and other post- transcriptional alterations; and to quantify the modifying expression levels of each transcript during evolution and under various situations.

Radiogenomics Radiogenomics is the newest member of omics family. The concept of radiogenomics is the study of the correlation between cancer imag - ing features and gene expression (Imaging Genomics) and genotypic variations observed in response to radiation therapy (Radiation Genomics) . The combination of imaging tools with molecular techniques (such as func - tional genomics assays) offers the potential for the quick clinical translation of powerful high- throughput technology . Radiogenomics may create imaging biomarkers that can recog - nize the genomics of a disease, particularly cancer, without the use of a biopsy . Numerous techniques are applied to reveal cor - relations between MRI, CT, and PET imaging features and the genomics of disease (such as large-scale MRI microRNA -mRNA correlative study in glioblastoma, liver cancer genome from non-invasive imaging features, and link image characteristics of non-small cell lung nodules in CT scans) to predict survival using gene expression data . In addition, func - tional CT in oncology and cardiovascular imag - ing is a key player in the age of precision medi - cine and radiogenomics . Proteomics Proteomics, the study of proteomes on a large scale, promises to transform biology and medi - cine [42, 43]. The study of proteomes in the large scale is defined as proteomics. A pro - teome is defined as the set of proteins that is generated in a system, organism, or other bio - logical entity. For example, we can refer to the proteome of an organ, such as the liver, or of a species, such as Homo sapiens. The proteome changes from cell to cell at any given time; thus, it is not constant . The term “complete pro - teome” is applied in the field of mass spectrom - etry (MS)-based proteomics, pointing toward the presently unachieved aim realizing all the proteins of a given species . To investigate proteomes, several high-throughput techniques have been developed, among them mass spec - trometry (MS)-based techniques, such as tan - dem-MS, and gel-based techniques, such as differential in-gel electrophoresis, which are the most utilized in proteomics. Via these high- performance devices, we can produce enor - mous amounts of data. Therefore, we require databases for registering, storing, and main - taining these huge amounts of data so that investigators can create links between their outcomes and the available knowledge [44, 46]. Metabolomics Metabolomics enables the integration and merging of biological data from different levels, revealing communication and connectivity inside a system as a key for precision medicine and phenotyping . Metabolomics is an omics technique in systems medicine that is used in the global quantitative evaluation of endogenous metabolites in a biological system . Metabolomics is progressing, with power - ful technology enabling the assay and detec - tion of the huge numbers of metabolites in tis - sues and biofluids [49, 50]. Currently, metabo - lomics research can provide applicable and useful information regarding health and dis - ease status. Metabolomics techniques such as NMR and mass spectroscopy are applied to detect and treat various cancers . In recent years, the universal metabolic profiling of dis - eases has become feasible via the use of high- throughput analytical devices . Systems approaches in cancer management At present, researchers utilize a number of complementary omics techniques to investi - gate an extensive range of diseases, including cancer . Major attempts have been made to apply systems biology approaches to oncol - ogy [22, 53, 54]. High-throughput and sophisti - cated omics technologies, such as genomics, radiogenomics, proteomics, and metabolo - mics, have provided a foundation for a new kind of oncological investigation . These advances in experimental systems biology, along with novel analytical techniques and quantitative imaging software tools, are helping to create a more perfect image of many can - cers connected to signaling routes [22, 55, 56]. Recently, metabolomics approaches have been applied as an important tool for detection, prognosis, biomarker discovery, and the design of therapeutics . Denkert et al. utilized gas chromatography/time of flight mass spectrom - Precision medicine and molecular imaging 316 Am J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 2016;6:310-327etry (GC-TOF-MS) to analyze ovarian cancer metabolism in both invasive carcinomas and borderline tumors [58, 59]. In recent studies, Japanese investigators have diagnosed gastro - enterological cancer via the metabolomic dis - covery of a pancreatic cancer biomarker . Wikoff et al. have succeeded in discovering blood-based biomarkers relevant to lung can - cer screening and early detection via metabolo - mic analysis approaches . In the field of thyroid cancer investigation, there are abun - dant studies demonstrating the successful application of omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Metabolomics tools have been utilized in iden - tifying a great number of metabolites in thyroid cancer in recent years . Systems biology/ medicine approaches also improve the under - standing, treatment, and clinical management of neuroendocrine prostate cancer . A schematic illustration of the metabolomics- based systems medicine and molecular imag - ing tools used in cancer diagnosis studies is presented in Figure 2 . P4 medicine Medicine is now experiencing a major revolu - tion that will change the current healthcare sys - tem from reactive to proactive in every way [19, 39, 64]. In fact, systems biology and the digital revolution are transforming healthcare into a proactive type of P4 medicine, meaning that it is predictive, preventive, personalized, and par - ticipatory [64, 65]. However, the term of “per - sonalized medicine” is an expression for a revolution in medicine that will be predictive, universal, and integrative approach to biology. More specifically, systems medicine is a sys - tems approach to health and disease. Systems biology provides the strategies, instruments, and computational and analytical capabilities needed to analyze huge amounts of informa - tion [19, 29, 69]. These strategies and tools can be utilized in order to combat diseases . Here, we will debate precision medicine in the form of molecular imaging: 1) Personalized: P4 medicine will be ‘personalized’ because it will be established based on the genetic and epigenetic data of each person. Individualized or precision medicine may assist in data mining regarding quantitative biology and anatomy, in targeted imaging/targeted therapy, and also in the real-time monitoring of treatment response. Molecular imaging can provide special molecu - lar profiles and assist in selecting the most effi - cient treatment with the minimum toxicity on a personalized basis [39, 71-73]. Imaging agents that have both diagnostic and therapeutic abili - ties, or ‘theragnostics’, will probably be more cost-effective and popular [39, 74]. The great advantage of molecular imaging in personal - ized medicine is its ability to merge physiologic and metabolic data with clinical phenotypes and provide inestimable information concern - ing treatments. 2) Predictive: generally, one human being differs from another by less than 1% in terms of their hereditary structure. These genetic differences cause physical differences, such as the tendency to develop various dis - eases [39, 75]. Medicine will be ‘predictive’ because this individual data will allow physi - cians to estimate the risk of particular diseases Figure 2. A schematic illustration of metabolomics-based systems medicine and molecular imaging tools into cancer diagnosis studies. preventive, personalized, and participatory. This aspect of medicine was nominated P4 medicine [19, 66]. P4 medi - cine comprises of predictive, preventive, personalized, and participatory medicine [2, 64, 65, 67]. The essence of P4 medicine is the quantification of healthiness or wellness and the clarification of dis - ease . P4 medicine will 1) create better healthcare, 2) decrease the cost of health - care, and 3) motivate innova - tion and the creation of new corporations . Meanwhile, systems biology is a holistic, Precision medicine and molecular imaging 317 Am J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 2016;6:310-327in each person [39, 73]. Imaging modalities will play a meaningful role as non-invasive screening methods that are both sensitive and accurate predictors of disease [39, 76]. Investigations have shown that only PET influ - enced management decisions in 38% of cancer cases [39, 77]. 3) Preventive: medicine will be ‘preventive’ because the prediction of risk will permit the utilization of prophylactic proce - dures (way of life or therapeutic) to reduce this risk. Molecular/genetic screening and interven - tion (often directed by imaging) are the most effective methods of disease management [39, 73]. Theragnostic agents can also be used. 4) Participatory: medicine will be ‘participatory’ due to the fact that most of these prophylactic manipulations will require the participation of the patient. This consists of a domain of partici - patory activities, such data sharing, training [29, 64]. Furthermore, the biology and disease are unbelievable complicated [19, 79]. The pre - cision medicine has extremely developed by advance of high-throughput technologies and systems approaches. Indeed, the field of preci - sion medicine is changing the paradigm of future health care from conventional medicine practice (diagnosis and treatment) to predictive and preventative medicine and personalized health supervising [80, 81]. Progress of high- throughput technologies like high-throughput sequencing and mass spectrometry has made capable researchers, scientists and clinicians to study genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, and other omics data in unex - ampled detail. The integrated ‘omics’ data can be led to a universal profiling of health and dis - ease, and provide novel approaches for P4 medicine and health monitoring [64, 82-85]. patients and physicians, and also counseling patients re- garding individual options con - nected to sickness and well- being. The increasing utiliza - tion of social networks by patients, and also the activi - ties of patients’ associations, are examples of participatory actions [39, 73]. It is also anticipated that “technology singularity” and “exponential medicine”, as new approach - es, will shift the paradigm of medical philosophy and gener - ate a considerable influence on the healthcare system and patient-physician relationship . Here, a schematic repre - sentation of the procedure for precision medicine (predic - tive, preventive, personalized and participatory) and two principal objectives of the pre - cision medicine are demon - strated ( Figure 3 ). Linkage of the systems ap - proaches and precision medi - cine Systems biology is growing quickly, and the term “preci - sion medicine” has also emerged as a significant revo - lution in modern medicine Figure 3. A schematic representation of the procedure of precision medicine (predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory) and two principal ob - jectives of precision medicine as future of medicine comprising: 1) Quantify - ing wellness, 2) Demystifying disease. Precision medicine and molecular imaging 318 Am J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 2016;6:310-327The power of systems biology in personalized medicine lies in disease risk estimation, per - sonalized health monitoring and preventative medicine more significantly and it is not only for disease mechanism explanation. Systems biology provides forceful tools to supervise molecular profiles and discern delicate chang - es that can demonstrate network disturbance. Physicians and pathologists are energetically combining systems biology and medicine tools to attain molecular disease diagnosis [86, 87]. Regarding to undergoing period in medicine, we require contributing between systems biology and molecular imaging in the future medicine. Therefore, we will be able to estimate and monitor of personalized disease risk and health care with applying integrative omics techni- ques and molecular imaging technologies. We may connect systems biology and systems medicine via the implementation of omics tech - nologies, which are the most efficient tools available in modern biology and precision medi - cine for disease diagnosis ( Figure 4 ). Relationship of imaging and systems ap - proaches in precision medicine Molecular imaging and systems biology approaches play an important role in develop -gy. Recently, the radiogenomics/radiomics and radiotranscriptomics technology has emerged as a new area of omics in molecular imaging field [36, 88]. In fact, novel imaging strategies in the era of precision medicine require the focus on improved characterization of disease by phenotyping disease specific imaging char - acteristics within the concept of genetic patient information in order to non-invasively identify patient subpopulations that benefit from simi - lar treatments or vice versa . On the other side, radiology requires “Big-Data” analysis that is feasible by bioinformatics and systems biology approaches. Since, the radiogenomics generates large amount of genotyping data by imaging from gene expression profile and geno - typing variation . The precision medicine requires the individual genetic data to assess many characteristics in cancer detection and diagnosis by researchers. Molecular imaging contributes with systems biology methods (such as computational and modeling) to ana - lyze and interpret the image results. Indeed, the synergy of imaging, genomics, transcrip - tomics and other omics data can be construct - ed a bridge between systems biology approach and molecular imaging leads to precision medicine goals [36, 92-94] ( Figure 5 ). These progressions provide opportunities for the Figure 4. The components that will permit to precision medicine for discover - ing the biological complexity. These emerging technologies such as systems biology approaches and molecular imaging techniques will enable the imple - mentation of precision medicine. ing precision medicine in the cancer management . The evolvement of high-through - put technologies able to com - prehensively evaluate DNA, RNA, protein, and metabolites in tumors management . High-throughput experiments such as genomics, radioge - nomics, transcriptomics, ra- diotranscriptomics, proteomi- cs, radioproteomics, metabo - lomics and radiometabolo - mics provide a basis for new kinds of oncology investiga - tion. These progresses in sys - tems biology linked with mod - ern analytical and also quanti - tative imaging software tools are assisting to create a more complete picture of many cancer related signaling path - ways and personalized can- cer management [22, 90, 91]. The omics technologies are major basis of systems biolo - Precision medicine and molecular imaging 319 Am J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 2016;6:310-327advancement of personalized oncology in which cancer detection, diagnosis and therapy are tailored to each individual’s molecular profile.

There has been a vast growth in the number and type of imaging technologies and their uses in past three decades, although some issues remain. At present, molecular imaging is an emerging subject that integrates advanced imaging tech - nology with cellular and molecular biology . The molecular imaging term can be defined as visual representation, characterization, mea - surement and quantification of biological pro - cesses at the molecular, cellular and sub-cellu - lar within entire living organisms using specific and appropriate imaging probes [11, 96, 97]. Molecular imaging technologies play a crucial role in earlier detection, precise diagnosis of diseases like cancerous tumors, and drug development and discovery [95, 98-100] Figure 7.

Precision medicine and molecular imaging 322 Am J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 2016;6:310-327(Figure 6 ). Molecular imaging needs to high resolution and high sensitive tools to detect and realize specific imaging agents that con - nect the imaging signal with molecular occur - rence [95, 101]. There are copious classes of molecular imaging agents comprising small molecules, peptides, aptamers, high-molecu - lar-weight antibodies, engineered protein frag - ments, and various nanoparticles . At present, only some of evolving of molecular imaging technologies is used in clinical and pre - clinical stage e.g. Positron-emission tomogra - phy (PET), single-photon-emission CT (SPECT), fluorescence reflectance imaging, fluores - cence-mediated tomography (FMT), fibre-optic microscopy, optical frequency-domain imaging, bioluminescence imaging, laser-scanning con - focal microscopy and multiphoton microscopy [95, 98, 102-105].
