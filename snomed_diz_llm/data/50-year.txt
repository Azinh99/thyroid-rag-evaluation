ANAPLASTIC THYROID CARCINOMA (ATC) is among the most aggressive malignancies and stands in stark contrast to the usually indolent behavior of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Although ATC represents only 2% to 5% of clinically recognized cancers of the thyroid gland, 1 more than half of the approximately 1200 deaths attributed to thyroid cancer annually in the United States result from ATC. Mortality rates of 70% to 95% have been reported, but a small proportion of patients experience long-term survival. 2,3 ATC includes large-cell, spindle-cell, and small-cell variants. 4 However, recent advances in immunohistology have shown that most of the small-cell tumors are actually non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the thyroid, medullary carcinoma, or "insular" variants of follicular carcinoma, all of which may carry a better prognosis than ATC. 5 Few large studies have been reported of histologically well-defined ATC, based on current histologic criteria. Our understanding of prognostic variables remains poor, and the roles of operation, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are uncertain, although a number of small studies have reported improved outcomes after multimodal therapy. [6][7][8] We report the results of a large retrospective review of patients managed at a single institution for a diagnosis of ATC during a 50-year period. In all cases, the histology was reviewed and the diagnosis was confirmed by current criteria. The clinical presentation, association with pre-existing benign and malignant thyroid disease, outcomes, and impact of treatment are presented for this almost universally lethal malignancy.These studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board. We identified all cases of anaplastic, undifferentiated, or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) presenting to this institution between 1949 and 1999. Patients were excluded if they had received prior treatment for this diagnosis or if more than 30 days had passed

McIver et al 1029 Volume 130, Number 6   since the diagnosis was made. One pathologist (J.R.G.) reviewed the original pathology material, and ATC was diagnosed by current histologic criteria, 9 including large or spindle-shaped cells, cellular and nuclear atypia, high mitotic rate, and necrosis. Immunohistochemistry for thyroglobulin and cytokeratin was performed, particularly in small-cell lesions, to exclude lymphoma, whereas staining for calcitonin and amyloid excluded medullary carcinoma. Cases with clear squamous differentiation were also excluded.
Clinical, surgical, pathologic, and follow-up details were obtained from the medical record. We reviewed death certificates and autopsy reports when available. A postal survey determined the status of patients who remained alive at the time of last contact. Local recurrence was identified clinically, and distant metastases were diagnosed radiologically, without requiring histologic confirmation, which rarely was obtained. We attributed death to ATC if there was evidence of progressive disease in the patient's terminal illness and no other proximate cause of death was identified.
We used a software package (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) for statistical analysis. Differences between groups were assessed with a chi-square test and survival with life-table analysis. A P value of .05 or less was considered statistically significant.

ATC was confirmed in 134 cases, and all patients were followed up to either their death or to December 1999, a median of 3 months. The mean of 2.7 cases per year showed no change during 5 decades (Fig 1). Of the 134 patients, 80 (60%) were women and 54 (40%) were men, a female to male ratio of 1.5:1. The mean age was 67 years, and the age distribution is shown in Fig 2. No change in the age or sex distribution was seen during 50 years (data not shown).
Pre-existing thyroid disease. Six patients (4.5%) had a prior history of DTC. All had been treated with operation and postoperative radioactive iodine. In 5 of the 6 cases, the original DTC histology was available and showed papillary carcinoma (PTC) in all 5. The remaining case had been reported as follicular carcinoma (FTC). ATC was diagnosed in these patients between 2 and 32 years after the diagnosis of DTC (mean, 9.5 years). An additional 25 patients had coincidentally noted DTC on examination of surgically resected ATC; 17 of these (68%) had PTC, and the remainder had FTC. Overall, 31 (23%) patients showed evidence of pre-existing or co-existing DTC, and 22 (71%) of them had PTC. An additional 27 (20%) patients had recognized (n = 8) and previously unrecognized (n = 19) thyroid nodules or goiter. Overall, pre-existent or co-existent thyroid disease was seen in 58 patients (43%).
Clinical presentation and diagnosis. Almost all patients (n = 130; 97%) presented with a rapidly enlarging neck mass, and the remainder were diagnosed on the basis of either pulmonary (n = 3) or skeletal (n = 1) metastases. Sixty-two patients (46%) had evidence of metastases at diagnosis. These included pulmonary or mediastinal metastases (56 of the 133 in whom chest imaging was performed), skeletal metastases (9 of 28 in whom bone scanning was performed), or brain metastases (1 of 11 in whom head computed tomography scanning was performed). Distant metastases were detected at some stage of the illness in 91 patients (68%).
Pathology. Large-cell ATC was seen in 38%, spindle cell in 40%, and a mixed picture was seen in 22%.

The primary tumor averaged 6.6 cm (range, 1.5-16 cm), and local invasion was evident in 131 (98%) patients at diagnosis. In all cases for which documentation was adequate, regional lymph nodes within the neck were involved, often massively so.
Initial therapy. Five patients (4%) were treated palliatively. External beam irradiation (XRT) was administered after open biopsy in 29 patients (22%), and chemotherapy was administered in 4 (3%) patients. Operation was the primary management in 96 cases (72%), with 48 (50%) patients undergoing "debulking" procedures and 35 (36%) an intended "curative" procedure. Operation was terminated after biopsy alone in the remaining 13 cases (14%) because of extensive local infiltration. In patients who had a surgical procedure that was more extensive than biopsy alone (n = 83), the procedures ranged from lobectomy to total thyroidectomy with complex neck dissection. The distribution of these procedures is shown in Fig 3.
Lymph-node dissection was variable, but most patients had extensive cervical lymphadenopathy. The extent of this disease and massive soft-tissue invasion were the most commonly documented factors preventing complete surgical resection. The surgical approach varied during 5 decades, as shown in Fig 4 . During the 1960s, most patients underwent biopsy alone, followed by XRT as primary therapy. In contrast, during the 1970s, all patients underwent operation as primary treatment. In recent decades, operation was used for most patients, whereas primary XRT was reserved for massive disease, for which an operation was believed to carry excessive risk.
Complete resection of the tumor was achieved in 29 of the surgically treated patients (30%), whereas a further 25 (26%) were documented to have only "minimal residual disease" after the primary surgical procedure. Gross residual disease was present after operation in 42 patients (44%).
Subsequent therapy. Postoperatively, 41 of the 42 patients with gross residual disease (98%) and 38 of the 54 patients with total or near-total resection of the tumor (70%) received XRT for the primary tumor. XRT was also used to treat local recurrences (n = 5) and metastatic disease (n = 4). However, a local recurrence or metastatic deposit was demonstrated to decrease in size in only a single patient, and XRT was administered largely as end-of-life palliation, with no further assessment undertaken in most patients.
Chemotherapy alone was administered to 4 patients (3%) and as postoperative adjunctive therapy for the treatment of distant metastases in 12 (9%). In the last 20 years, 13 patients have received "combination therapy" with a debulking (sometimes extensive) procedure, XRT, and adjunctive chemotherapy (doxorubicin [Adriamycin]) for "radiosensitization."
Outcomes and follow-up. The median survival was 3 months, with 32 patients (23%) surviving less than 1 month from the time of diagnosis (Fig 5). Death was attributed to ATC in 127 of the 131 patients who have died (97%), with myocardial infarction and stroke causing the other 4 deaths. Thirteen patients (9.7%) have survived more than 1 year from diagnosis. The longest-surviving patient remains alive with no evidence of disease 23 years after the diagnosis and treatment of ATC. This patient, aged 50, had a 6.1-cm intrathyroidal primary, with 3 small lymph nodes involved, and no evidence of distant metastases (pT3 N1 M0) and was Surgical procedures undertaken in 83 patients, whose initial primary therapy was surgical and whose disease was considered "operable" at the time of operation. Procedures ranged from lobectomy with tumor debulking to extensive complex operation with curative intent by radical or modified-radical neck dissection. Both operation and radiotherapy improved survival over palliative treatment alone, with patients who received only palliative care having a median survival of 3 weeks compared with 2.3 months for patients treated with radiotherapy (P < .005) and 3.5 months for patients treated surgically (P < .01). However, neither the extent of operation nor the achieved completeness of resection (Fig 6) had a significant impact on survival, with a median survival of 2.3 months for patients with gross residual disease after operation and 4 months for patients with complete tumor resection (P = .3).
Local recurrence was seen in 20 (37%) of the 54 patients with complete or near-complete surgical resection after a median of 2.5 months. The rate of local recurrence did not differ between patients with complete resection and those with minimal residual disease (38% vs 36%; P > .6). Postoperative XRT after complete or near-complete resection of the primary tumor did not reduce the risk of local recurrence (P = .15), but the time to develop that recurrence (Fig 7) was slightly (but not significantly) longer: 5 months vs 3 months; P = .08. The median survival after a local recurrence was 66 days, and there was no difference in survival between patients whose recurrence was treated with XRT and those who received conservative treatment (P = .44). No patient was treated surgically for locally recurrent disease.
Since 1980, 13 patients were treated with multimodal therapy, with debulking operation, postoperative XRT, and radiosensitizing chemotherapy. The median survival among these patients does not differ (P = .32) from the group as a whole (Fig 8 ), suggesting that such a combined approach was no more effective than operation alone in the management of these patients with ATC. Despite that, a small number of long-term (> 1 year) survivors was seen in this group (n = 3), a rate of 23%, compared with less than 10% in the group as a whole. Although not statistically significant (P = .19), this result justifies further study in selected patients.

ATC is a rare disease, representing a diminishing proportion of thyroid carcinoma presenting to this and other institutions. 10 Despite its rarity, however, it remains one of the leading causes of thyroid cancer mortality. 2 With few cases presenting to any one institution, it is difficult to assess the impact of operation and other therapy, and there are only a few previous reports of outcomes in large groups of ATC. 3,[11][12][13][14][15][16] Some tumors previously classified as ATC in fact represent other thyroid cancer types, often with a better prognosis. In particular, cases previously diagnosed as small-cell ATC often stain for lymphocyte markers 17 and are now classified as thyroid lymphoma and should be treated accordingly. Immunohistochemical stains for calcitonin and  The impact of operation on survival after a diagnosis of ATC. In the 96 patients in whom operation was the primary treatment method, survival was not improved by achieving apparently complete surgical resection. Patients with gross residual disease postoperatively had a slightly shorter survival (2.3 months) than those whose resection was more complete (4 months), but these differences were not statistically significant.

carcinoembryonic antigen can distinguish poorly differentiated medullary thyroid carcinoma from true ATC, whereas poorly differentiated ("insular") follicular carcinoma can be recognized by careful histologic examination. 15 It is important to rigorously exclude these tumor types, which may favorably bias survival rates, particularly because of the good response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy of some lymphomas.
This study reports the presentation and outcomes of 134 patients with rigorously defined ATC managed in a single institution during 5 decades. Details of surgical and medical treatments as well as follow-up and outcome data were available on all patients. We confirmed the previously reported sex distribution of ATC, [13][14][15] with a female-to-male ratio of 1.5:1 in this study. Similarly, the disease remains one of middle-aged or elderly patients, with an average age at diagnosis of 67 years. A few patients do present at younger ages, however, and 33 of these patients (25%) were younger than 60 years old at diagnosis. ATC may arise in some cases from pre-existing differentiated thyroid cancer, 1 and DTC components are seen in a proportion of ATC cases on histologic review. 12,14 Current molecular models of thyroid carcinogenesis demonstrate a stepwise process of progressive genomic disarray, culminating in loss of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, with anaplastic transformation. 18 It remains a significant fear for many patients and physicians that inadequately treated differentiated thyroid carcinoma may undergo transformation to ATC. 1 The histologic review undertaken for this study revealed DTC in 25 patients with ATC who had no previous-ly recognized diagnosis of DTC. Only 6 patients had a history of clinically recognized DTC. Although anaplastic transformation of DTC can certainly occur, 19 it is a true rarity. Since most ATC showed no evidence of a DTC component, the stepwise model remains to be proven.
The presentation of ATC is almost always that of a rapidly progressive enlarging neck mass, often with symptoms of compression or invasion. Almost half (46%) the patients had metastatic disease at the time at diagnosis, and metastatic spread was recognized in almost 70% of patients at some stage in their illness. Local invasion and compression, leading to airway compromise and aspiration pneumonia, was the leading cause of death.
Surgical fashions have changed throughout the years, ranging from operation for almost no one (1960s) to operation for all (1970s). The approach taken during the last 2 decades has been one of debulking or complete operation when feasible, followed by XRT and sometimes chemotherapy. These changes in therapeutic strategies probably owe themselves to a persistent sense of frustration in the management of this lethal disease.
ATC remains almost universally fatal. In this study, mortality rates in excess of 90% were seen within 1 year of diagnosis, and median survival was only 3 months. These figures are worse than those reported in several previous studies, 12,20,21 though not others, 3,14,22 and this may reflect our rigorous exclusion of other cancer types. Despite advances in surgical technique, increasing use of XRT, and  Outcomes in 13 patients who received combined treatment with debulking operation, followed by Adriamycin chemotherapy, and XRT compared with the remaining patients treated with "traditional" approaches of operation or XRT. Although no difference in overall survival is seen, a larger proportion of patients treated in this way achieve "long-term" survival of more than 1 year (23% vs 10%; P = .19).

the introduction of adjunctive radiosensitizing chemotherapy, there is little evidence that our current approach to this disease has yielded significant benefit for these patients. 23 Although operation was associated with a longer life expectancy than palliation alone (3.5 months rather than 3 weeks), part of this apparent benefit may reflect selection bias, since patients selected for operation are likely to have less extensive disease. The difference in survival between patients who underwent extensive operation and those who underwent biopsy alone followed by XRT was small and did not reach statistical significance (3.5 vs 2.5 months; P = .1). Once again, a selection bias toward operation for patients with smaller tumors and less extensive local invasion may influence these results.
Radiotherapy may also play a role in delaying local recurrence after surgical debulking. Although this did not reach statistical significance because of small numbers, a useful palliation may be reflected in this slightly prolonged time to recurrence (5 vs 3 months) seen after complete or near-complete surgical resection.
Combination treatment with extensive operation, postoperative XRT, and possibly chemotherapy appears to carry little advantage on the basis of these data. Even though several small pilot studies and case reports have suggested a possible beneficial effect, [6][7][8] the 13 patients in this study who underwent such multimodality therapy did not demonstrate a longer median survival. Despite this, a small number of patients (3/13; 23%) treated this way achieved "longterm survivor" status (> 1 year), and although a selection bias is once again possible, further clinical trials, preferably in the form of a multicenter, randomized prospective study, are certainly justified.
ATC is a lethal malignancy, and we have seen no improvement in outcome during 50 years. Operation alone is insufficient to extend life, and more aggressive management provides no significant additional benefit in most patients. For tumors that are amenable to total or near-total resection, operation followed by XRT is justified. However, the use of adjunctive chemotherapy remains unproven and should be submitted to clinical trials. New approaches to the management of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma are desperately needed.

Dr Ashok Shaha (New York, NY). I enjoyed your paper. Clearly, this is one of the largest series of anaplastic thyroid 1034

carcinoma from one institution. However, your experience spans over a period of 50 years, and a retrospective study like this is quite difficult to interpret. You have included 3 different types of anaplastic thyroid cancers, including preexisting thyroid disease and the presence of differentiated carcinoma. When reviewing anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, it is very important that we separate these groups into preexisting benign thyroid disease, well-differentiated carcinoma, and the classical giant and spindle cell carcinoma. It is also important to distinguish small cell anaplastic thyroid cancers, which in the past were reported as anaplastic thyroid cancer and, on detailed immunohistochemistry, some of them might have been lymphomas.
I was also quite surprised to see a high incidence of surgical intervention in your series. You had 30% of the patients having undergone complete tumor resection, while 46% of the patients had distant metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis. It would be interesting to see the resection rates in various histologies. I feel that the true incidence of surgical resectability in classical anaplastic thyroid cancer (giant and spindle cell cancer) would be extremely low. The incidence of 62% of patients having surgery with curative intent is not our experience in general. I would also appreciate it if you could comment on these patients.
In our experience, managing the airway in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer has been a challenging issue for the surgeon. Our general experience is that the tumor does fungate through the trachea. Tracheostomy is often necessary to maintain airway in emergent situations. The majority of anaplastic thyroid cancers we see are extremely aggressive locally with essentially frozen central compartments. The large mass is technically unresectable most of the time. The small anaplastic thyroid cancers you have seen, measuring approximately 1.5 cm, are essentially incidental findings, and these patients do much better in general. Again, I enjoyed your paper and complement you on your large series.
Dr McIver. Thank you for your comments, which are very valuable.
Regarding the airway, a large proportion of these patients underwent tracheostomy at the time of their primary surgery. This was almost universal when aggressive surgical approaches were used, particularly in the 1970s. However, whether this is an appropriate management strategy remains unknown. We have no evidence to suggest that airway protection is effective, either in terms of survival, quality of life, or quality of death. This is an unpleasant disease to die from, and placing a tracheostomy may not improve that process.
We have not subdivided our patients into those with preexisting thyroid disease and those without, in part because of concern that we may have missed some prior diagnoses of benign thyroid disease through inadequate documentation, a common problem for retrospective reviews. Only a tiny minority was recognized to have preexisting differentiated thyroid cancer, however. Although it might suggest a different disease process from the de novo anaplastic cancers, they are histologically indistinguishable. It would be interesting, as you suggest, to analyze that group separately to determine if the prognosis is different, but my impression is that both types of patients fare poorly.
Like you, we were surprised to find that such a high proportion of the patients in this retrospective review had undergone surgery as primary treatment. I do not think that this reflects our current experience. I believe that the majority of patients with ATC whom we see currently, present with locally very advanced disease, and are regarded by our surgeons as "inoperable", for good reason. However, some of the tumors included in this review were small, with the smallest being a mere 1.5 cm in maximum diameter, and surgery was pursued as primary treatment in the majority of patients who presented with disease that was felt to be operable. Larger tumors, with more local infiltration would at most be treated with a debulking procedure, followed by external beam irradiation.
x. I have a question regarding your comments about debulking. You indicated that the median life expectancy of the patients in your series was 2.9 months. Given the extremely poor outcome from this disease, what is the role for debulking? What are you trying to accomplish with debulking?
Dr McIver. The truth is that a lot of what we have done for this disease over the last 50 years has been driven more by a sense of frustration and a desire to do something to help these patients, than on any basis in science. Unfortunately, the evidence I have presented today suggests that we are not really impacting the disease by performing even what we would commonly regard as "curative" surgery. Nor, indeed, have any of our other traditional modes of therapy helped.
I believe we need to be taking a much more innovative and aggressive approach to chemotherapeutic regimens if we are going to make any impact on this disease. In my view, these approaches should be undertaken in the form of multicenter trial, and I would encourage all of us to cooperate in designing and running such a trial. We will never get the answers otherwise.
Dr Edwin Kaplan (Chicago, Ill). I share your frustration with this disease. We recently treated 4 patients with very aggressive chemotherapy, including Taxol, as well as highdose external beam radiation therapy. Only those who did well with this regimen were to be operated upon.
Of the 4, we ended up operating on only 1 person, who had a complete surgical resection. She has done well and is a long-term survivor. The other 3 developed metastatic disease while on this very aggressive chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Furthermore, the chemotherapy produced considerable morbidity.
Dr McIver. I agree entirely. In our recent experience of treating these patients with triple therapy, it is not uncommon to gain apparent local control over the disease in the neck, only to see metastatic disease develop. This is rapidly progressive and results in the patients' deaths. These outcomes add to our sense of frustration in the face of a devastatingly lethal disease.
