Overview Thyroid nodules, often palpated during routine physi - cal examination, are relatively common and increase in frequency throughout life, reaching a prevalence of approximately 5% of US individuals aged ≥50 years having palpable thyroid nodules.1–3 Nodules are even more prevalent when the thyroid gland is examined at autopsy or surgery, or when using ultrasonography; 50% of the thyroids studied have nodules, which are almost always benign.2,4 By contrast, thyroid carcinoma is un - common. For the US population, the lifetime risk of be - ing diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma is 1.2%,5 with an estimated 53,990 new cases of thyroid carcinoma being diagnosed in 2018.6 As with thyroid nodules, thyroid carcinoma occurs 2 to 3 times more often in women than in men and is currently the fifth most common malignancy diagnosed in women.6 The main histologic types of thyroid carcinoma are  differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC; including papillary, follicular, and Hürthle cell);  medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC); and  anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC).

DTC usually has an excellent prognosis, with 10-year survival rates exceeding 90% to 95%.7 In contrast, ATC, an aggressive undiffer - entiated tumor, is almost uniformly lethal. However, because DTCs represent >95% of all cases, most thy - roid carcinoma deaths are from papillary, follicular, and Hürthle cell carcinomas. In 2018, it is estimated that approximately 2,060 cancer deaths will occur among persons with thyroid carcinoma in the Unit - ed States.6 The stable age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate for thyroid carcinoma contrasts distinctly with the declining rates for other solid tumors in adults, and highlights the need for new treatment options for advanced thyroid cancers.5,8,9 The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in On - cology (NCCN Guidelines) for Thyroid Carcinoma provide recommendations for management of the different types of thyroid carcinoma, including papil - lary, follicular, Hürthle cell, MTC, and ATC. These NCCN Guidelines Insights summarize the panel dis - cussion behind recent updates to the guidelines, in - cluding the expanding role of molecular testing for DTC, implications of the new pathologic diagno - sis of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP), and the ad - dition of a new targeted therapy option for BRAF V600E–mutated ATC. Molecular Testing for DTC Molecular testing for DTC may be conducted for di - agnostic, prognostic, and/or predictive purposes. Be - cause many thyroid cancers have an excellent prog - nosis and benign nodules are common, diagnostic or prognostic markers can be useful for evaluating suspi - cious thyroid nodules so that appropriate treatment options can be determined.1,10,11 Predictive markers, © JNCCN—Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | Volume 16 Number 12 | December 2018Thyroid Carcinoma, Version 2.20181433 NCCN Guidelines InsightsCE PAP-9Structurally persistent/recurrent locoregional or distant metastatic disease not amenable to RAI therapy • Continue to suppress TSH with levothyroxineh • For advanced, progressive, or threatening disease, genomic testing to identify actionable mutationsIodine-refractory soft tissue metastases (eg, lung, liver , muscle) excluding CNS metastases (see below ) Iodine- refractory metastatic bone metastasesz CNS metastasesTREA TMENT OF LOCAL LY RECURRENT , ADVANCED, AND/OR MET ASTA TIC DISEASE NOT AMENABLE TO RAI THERAPY • For progressive and/or symptomatic disease, consider lenvatinib (preferred)aa or sorafenib.bb • While not FD A approved for the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer , other commercially available smal l-molecular kinase inhibitors can be considered for progressive and/or symptomatic disease if clinical trials or other systemic therapies are not available or appropriate. cc,dd,ee • Consider resection of distant metastases and/or EBRT/SBRT/IMRT/other local therapiesff when available to metastatic lesions if progressive and/or symptomatic.

The fol - lowing sections detail the NCCN panel’s discussions on the use of molecular markers for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. Diagnostic/Prognostic Markers Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with ultrasound guid - ance is the preferred procedure for evaluating suspi - cious thyroid nodules.3,11,12 FNA of clinically signifi - cant or suspicious cervical lymph nodes should also be considered if identified in the ultrasonographic evalu - ation of the thyroid and neck. Cytologic examination of an FNA specimen is typically categorized as: • Category I: nondiagnostic or unsatisfactory biopsy; • Category II: benign (ie, nodular goiter, colloid goiter, hyperplastic/adenomatoid nodule, Hashi - moto’s thyroiditis); • Category III: atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) or follicular lesion of undetermined sig - nificance (FLUS); • Category IV: follicular neoplasm or suspicious for follicular neoplasm (includes Hürthle cell neoplasm); • Category V: suspicious for malignancy; or • Category VI: malignancy (includes papillary, MTC, ATC or lymphoma). These diagnostic categories for FNA results re - flect the 2017 Bethesda System for Reporting Thy - roid Cytopathology.13 Molecular diagnostic testing to detect individual mutations (eg, BRAF V600E, RET/PTC , RAS, PAX8/ PPARγ) or pattern recognition approaches using mo - lecular classifiers may be useful in evaluating FNA samples that are indeterminate to assist in manage - ment decisions.14–22 The BRAF V600E mutation oc - curs in approximately 45% of papillary carcinomas © JNCCN—Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | Volume 16 Number 12 | December 2018Thyroid Carcinoma, Version 2.20181434NCCN Guidelines InsightsCE ANAP-2METASTATIC DISEASE Stage IVCcAggressive therapy Palliative care• Total thyroidectomy with therapeutic lymph node dissection if resectable (R0/R1) • Locoregional radiation therapy • Systemic therapy (See ANAP-A) • Molecular testing for actionable mutationsf,g • Consider clinical trial • Palliative locoregional radiation therapy • Local lesion control with surgery or radiation (eg, bone,h brain metastases) • See NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers • Best supportive care cSee Staging (ST -1). fConsider dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy if BRAF V600E mutation is positive. gSubbiah V, et al.

Rather than proceeding to immediate surgical re - section to obtain a definitive diagnosis for these inde - terminate FNA cytology groups (follicular neoplasm or AUS/FLUS), patients can be followed with active surveillance if the application of a specific molecular diagnostic test (in conjunction with clinical and ul - trasound features) results in a predicted risk of malig - nancy that is comparable to the rate seen in cytologi - cally benign thyroid FNAs (approximately ≤5%). It is important to note that the predictive value of mo - lecular diagnostics may be significantly influenced by the pretest probability of disease associated with the various FNA cytology groups. Furthermore, in the cy -tologically indeterminate groups, risk of malignancy from FNA can vary widely between institutions.13,31 Therefore, proper implementation of molecular diag - nostics into clinical care requires an understanding of both the performance characteristics of the specific molecular test and its clinical meaning across a range of pretest disease probabilities.32,33 The NCCN panel discussed the use of molecular diagnostic testing for evaluating FNA results of fol - licular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm or AUS/FLUS. Although most of the panel members agreed that they are using molecular diagnostics for this purpose, they expressed uncertainty regarding whether the testing was helpful in guiding treatment. Some panel members voiced concern that the struc - ture of THYR-4 placed too much emphasis on the role of molecular diagnostics. Therefore, the algorithm on THYR-4 was restructured to deemphasize molecular diagnostic testing and to allow an option for active surveillance when molecular diagnostics are not per - formed for AUS/FLUS (page 1431). In addition, the © JNCCN—Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | Volume 16 Number 12 | December 2018Thyroid Carcinoma, Version 2.20181435 NCCN Guidelines InsightsCE panel softened the recommendation for molecular di - agnostic testing by adding the word “consider” to em - phasize that implementation of molecular diagnostics is not mandatory in these cases. With these changes, a re-vote on molecular diagnostics changed the recom - mendation from category 2B to category 2A, reflect - ing the increasing number of institutions that consid - er molecular diagnostic testing to be an appropriate intervention, albeit not standard of care. Historically, studies have shown that molecular diagnostics do not perform well for Hürthle cell neo - plasms.34–36 A 2015 publication of 134 patients looked at the performance of the Afirma GEC (Veracyte, Inc.) in guiding management of FNA diagnoses of suspi - cious for Hürthle cell neoplasm or AUS concerning for Hürthle cell neoplasm. This study found that 86% of patients with suspicious findings on Afirma GEC had unnecessary surgery.36 However, results presented at the 2017 American Thyroid Association Annual Meeting described improved results using the Afirma Genomic Sequencing Classifier (Veracyte, Inc.) with 2 dedicated classifiers to  differentiate Hürthle cell–containing specimens from non-Hürthle specimens, and  dif - ferentiate neoplastic Hürthle specimens from nonneo - plastic. By applying this process to 186 specimens, this study reported an 88.9% sensitivity for detection of Hürthle cell malignancies and a 58.8% specificity for identification of benign Hürthle lesions, representing a marked improvement over previous results.37 Another molecular test, the ThyroSeq v3 Genomic Classifier (CBLPath, Inc.), has also shown promise for the diag - nosis of Hürthle cell–containing specimens. This test analyzes 112 genes for a variety of genetic alterations and was validated in 238 tissue samples and 174 FNA samples with known surgical follow-up. A 2018 publi - cation on the ThyroSeq v3 Genomic Classifier report - ed a sensitivity of 92.9% (95% CI, 80.52%–98.50%) and a specificity of 69.3% (95% CI, 48.21%–85.67%) for detecting Hürthle cell cancers.38 The NCCN panel discussed the limitations of molecular testing for Hürthle cell lesions at the panel meetings for both the 2017 and 2018 updates. Panel members’ experiences agreed with the published lit - erature on this subject—several commented that they did not use molecular testing for Hürthle cell lesions because the false-positive rates for malignancy were unacceptably high. In response, the panel added a footnote in the 2017 version to clarify that molecular diagnostic testing was not recommended for Hürthle cell neoplasms. For the 2018 update, the panel dis - cussed recent data showing that the Afirma Genomic Sequencing Classifier and the ThyroSeq v3 Genomic Classifier may perform better with Hürthle cell neo - plasms. The panel agreed that although the data were encouraging, they were not yet mature enough to make a recommendation for molecular testing in Hürthle cell lesions; however, they did soften the language of the footnote to read “molecular diagnostics may not perform well for Hürthle cell neoplasms” to account for these emerging data (see THYR-4, page 1431). Predictive Markers In addition to their utility in diagnostics, molecu - lar markers may drive decisions related to targeted therapy for advanced disease. Systemic therapy can be considered for locally recurrent, advanced, and/ or metastatic DTCs that are not surgically resectable, are not amenable to radioactive iodine (RAI), and are progressing and/or symptomatic. Overall, traditional cytotoxic systemic chemotherapy, such as doxorubi - cin, has minimal efficacy in patients with metastatic DTC.39 Therefore, novel treatments for patients with metastatic DTC have been evaluated. Agents with documented efficacy in this setting include lenva - tinib,40,41 sorafenib,42 sunitinib,43,44 axitinib,45–47 evero - limus,48 vandetanib,49 cabozantinib,50,51 and pazopanib among others.52 Severe or fatal side effects from kinase inhibitors include bleeding, hypertension, stroke, and liver toxicity; however, most side effects can be man - aged and are reversible with discontinuation of the drug.40–42,53 Dose modifications of kinase inhibitors may be required. Although the clinical use of predictive markers is currently limited for advanced thyroid cancers, recent data have shown that the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib can be effective treat - ment options for DTC harboring the BRAF V600E mutation.54–56 Because this mutation is common in papillary thyroid cancers, these therapies may be especially promising for this tumor type. An open- label nonrandomized phase II trial of 51 patients with BRAF V600E mutation–positive recurrent or metastatic papillary thyroid cancer that was refrac - tory to RAI investigated the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib.56 Of these 51 patients, 26 had never re - ceived a VEGFR-targeted therapy (cohort 1) and 25 had previously received this class of therapy (cohort 2). The primary end point, best overall response rate © JNCCN—Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | Volume 16 Number 12 | December 2018Thyroid Carcinoma, Version 2.20181436 NCCN Guidelines InsightsCE for cohort 1, was 38.5% (95% CI, 20.2–59.4). Grade ≥3 adverse events were reported in 65% of patients in cohort 1 and 68% in cohort 2.56 In a subset of 14 patients with BRAF V600E–mutant thyroid carcino - ma from a phase I study of dabrafenib, 29% showed partial responses and 64% showed at least a 10% decrease.54 In addition, another study of 10 patients with BRAF V600E–mutant, RAI-refractory papillary thyroid cancer showed that dabrafenib stimulated ra - dioiodine uptake in 60% of patients, suggesting that dabrafenib may sensitize these tumors to RAI ther - apy.55 Both of these studies reported that dabrafenib was well tolerated.54,55 Additionally, emerging data suggest that anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in - hibitors may be effective in patients with papillary carcinoma who have ALK gene fusion.57–60 In response to these emerging data, the pan - el added a recommendation for genomic testing to identify actionable mutations for patients with ad - vanced, progressive, or threatening DTC (see PAP- 9, page 1433). Panel members commented that mo - lecular testing is particularly important to inform eligibility for clinical trial participation. The panel also voted to add vemurafenib and dabrafenib as treatment options for patients with BRAF mutation– positive DTCs that are locally recurrent, advanced, and/or metastatic, are not surgically resectable, are not amenable to RAI, and are progressing and/or symptomatic (see PAP-9, page 1433). The decision was made to not specify BRAF V600E mutation, be - cause data show that these inhibitors can work for BRAF -activating mutations other than V600E.61 The panel discussed whether to add the dabrafenib/ trametinib combination (discussed for ATC in the following section) as an option for BRAF -mutated DTC, but decided to not add this regimen due to preliminary results from a phase II clinical trial for DTC presented at the 2017 ASCO Annual Meet - ing that did not show clear improvements compared with dabrafenib alone.62 NIFTP Pathologic Diagnosis NIFTP , formerly known as noninvasive encapsulat - ed follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (EFVPTC), is characterized by its follicular growth pattern, encapsulation or clear demarcation of the tumor from adjacent tissue with no invasion, and nuclear features of papillary carcinoma.63,64 NIFTP has a low risk for adverse outcomes and, therefore, requires less aggressive treatment.64–67 NIFTP was re - classified in 2016 to prevent overtreatment of this indolent tumor type and the psychological conse - quences of a cancer diagnosis on patients.63,64 The College of American Pathologists updated its proto - cols with NIFTP in the June 2017 version. Per their protocol, reporting is optional because NIFTP is not overtly malignant and only size, laterality, and mar - gin status are reported.68 Although molecular diagnostic testing may be useful for diagnosing NIFTP in the future, current - ly available tests were not validated using NIFTP samples. Studies have shown that NIFTP specimens frequently carry characteristic mutations/alterations, including RAS, PAX8/PPAR γ, and/or BRAF (with the exception of the aggressive BRAF V600 muta - tions), differentiating it from papillary subtypes that more frequently show BRAF V600E and RET/PTC alterations.18,69,70 However, multiple studies investi - gating the performance of molecular diagnostics for this subtype have reported that most thyroid nod - ules histologically diagnosed as NIFTP are classified as “suspicious” by GEC, possibly leading to more aggressive surgical treatment than is necessary.71,72 Therefore, the validation of molecular diagnostics with NIFTP samples will be necessary to ensure that the tests are accurately classifying these. The panel members agreed that although NIF - TP is still considered a subset of papillary carcino - ma, these tumors have low malignant potential and therefore do not require completion thyroidectomy after lobectomy. Based on this, the panel consen - sus was to conduct no further treatment after lobec - tomy and histologic diagnosis of NIFTP , and rather to proceed to active surveillance with consideration of thyroglobulin measurement and anti-Tg antibod - ies 6 to 12 weeks after lobectomy. Levothyroxine therapy may be considered to keep thyroid-stim - ulating hormone levels low to normal (see PAP-1, page 1432). At the time of the panel meeting, some panel members mentioned that the NIFTP termi - nology was still in the process of being accepted within practice patterns and that some institutions may still be classifying these tumors as EFVPTC. To address this, they decided to add a footnote clarify - ing that noninvasive EFVPTC had been reclassified as NIFTP . © JNCCN—Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | Volume 16 Number 12 | December 2018Thyroid Carcinoma, Version 2.20181437 NCCN Guidelines InsightsCE Systemic Therapy for ATC ATC is an aggressive undifferentiated tumor, with a disease-specific mortality approaching 100%.73 Treat - ment of ATC should be planned in consultation with a multidisciplinary team and ideally performed at a high-volume center with expertise in treating ATC. Therapy is often multimodal, consisting of sur - gery, systemic therapy, and/or radiation therapy, be - cause ATC often responds poorly to single-modality therapy.74,75 Given the poor outcome with current standard therapy, all patients—regardless of surgical resection—should be considered for clinical trials. Panel members commented that few therapies have emerged for treating ATC over the years. Giv - en the limited available treatments and a very poor prognosis, clinicians are grasping for options for these patients. With this in mind, the panel decided to add a recommendation to conduct molecular testing for actionable mutations in all patients with ATC who are considering systemic therapy (see ANAP-2, page 1434). Panel members agreed that molecular testing is part of the global approach to managing patients with ATC and is strongly recommended. Although there is now an FDA-approved therapy for ATC with the BRAF V600E mutation (discussed in the following paragraph), the panel does not intend for the recom - mendation regarding molecular testing to only apply to BRAF mutations; any targeted therapies that are ef - fective against an identified mutation/alteration may be considered (eg, crizotinib for ALK mutations). BRAF mutations have been reported in patients with ATC, supporting the utility of BRAF inhibi - tors for treatment.76–80 An open-label, nonrandom - ized, multicenter phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of dabrafenib in combination with tra - metinib for treatment of BRAF V600E–mutated rare cancers (including in a cohort of 16 patients with ATC).80 The primary end point, confirmed overall response rate, was 69% (95% CI, 41%–89%), with 7 responses ongoing. Although duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were not yet reached, the 12-month estimates were 90%, 79%, and 80%, respectively. The combination was found to be well tolerated as evaluated in 100 pa - tients across 7 rare tumor types; common adverse events included fatigue (38%), pyrexia (37%), and nausea (35%).80 Based on these data, the FDA ap - proved dabrafenib/trametinib for patients with ATC and BRAF V600E mutations on May 4, 2018.81The panel commented that the survival and re - sponse rate reported in this trial were very encourag - ing, especially for a disease with such a poor progno - sis. However, they cautioned that the small size of the ATC cohort (N=16) limited their ability to make a strong recommendation for this regimen. Therefore, the panel drafted a footnote suggesting consideration of dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy in BRAF V600E mutation–positive ATC (see ANAP-2, page 1434). Several panel members mentioned that their institutions have adopted testing for BRAF mu- tations and are treating patients with dabrafenib/tra - metinib when BRAF V600E mutations are detected. Anecdotally, they have noted impressive responses in patients with disease that responds to the therapy. The panel also discussed whether the dabrafenib/tra - metinib recommendation should be limited to only BRAF V600E, because deep sequencing will often yield multiple actionable mutations in this tumor type. The decision was to specify V600E mutation be - cause there are currently no data to guide how to treat ATC with other mutations. The panel looks forward to additional data with larger numbers of patients showing benefit from this regimen in BRAF -mutated ATC, at which time they may consider strengthening their recommendation. In the meantime, the panel stressed that clinical trial participation should still be the preferred treatment option for patients with ATC who qualify. Conclusions Recent medical advances have improved treatment for patients with thyroid cancers through better identifi - cation of indolent subtypes that require less aggressive treatment and the development of new targeted therapy options for advanced or metastatic disease. Although the data are not yet strong enough to be considered a standard of care, use of molecular diagnostics for inde - terminate FNA results may help some patients with indolent nodules avoid surgery. Likewise, the recent re - classification of the NIFTP subtype allows patients with this low-risk tumor to avoid total thyroidectomy and its associated side effects. However, molecular markers can also inform the use of targeted therapies and/or clinical trial eligibility for advanced or metastatic thyroid carci - noma. This approach is especially promising for ATC, a subtype with poor prognosis and few treatment options. © JNCCN—Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | Volume 16 Number 12 | December 2018Thyroid Carcinoma, Version 2.20181438 NCCN Guidelines InsightsCE
