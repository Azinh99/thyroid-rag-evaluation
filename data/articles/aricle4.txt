Methods: We retrospectively included 919 patients (586 Italian, 333 Dutch), and compared the two cohorts as a whole and according to ATA risk classes. Dynamic risk strati ﬁcation (DRS) and Kaplan –Meier curves were used to compare progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-speci ﬁc survival (DSS). Results: Several differences ( P< 0.001) were found in clinicopathological features and in diagnostic/therapeutic modalities. The Dutch cohort had a higher age at diagnosis, a higher number of patients presenting with metastatic disease, and patients with stage III/IV. Most Italian patients showed a low/intermediate ATA risk, while high-risk patients represented half of the Dutch cohort. The Dutch cohort received a more intensive ﬁrst treatment and more additional treatments during follow-up (i.e. surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic treatments). DRS analysis showed comparable excellent and biochemical incomplete responses, while the Dutch cohort had a lower rate of indeterminate and a higher rate of structural incomplete responses ( P< 0.001). The Dutch cohort had a signi ﬁcantly worse 5-year PFS, and TC-related mortality was 10 and 1% for the Dutch and Italian cohorts, respectively, in line with the higher rate of advanced disease at presentation, with DSS still excellent for both. Conclusion: Data reported in the present comparison between two European countries highlight a different prevalence, presentation, and outcome of DTC, likely due to variabilities in healthcare systems, iodine nutritional status, and diagnostic and treatment approaches.

Introduction The current epidemiological scenario of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), with the consistently rising incidence observed in the past 3 decades, strongly indicates the occurrence of overdiagnosis in manycountries . South Korea provides a striking example of this phenomenon, since cancer screening programmes incorporating neck ultrasound (US) led to a ﬁvefold increase in DTC incidence, making it the mostdiagnosed cancer among South Korean women ( 2,3). Similar trends are evident worldwide, largely because of the increased use of thyroid US and heightened medicalsurveillance. This often leads to the detection of small papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cases that would not have affected patients ’life expectancy if not diagnosed . Therefore, various scienti ﬁc societies now advocate more conservative diagnostic and treatment strategies (5,6). Major differences in TC incidence are still to be noted between countries: in particular, in Italy the DTC incidence is 36.7 cases per 100,000 women per year,while in the Netherlands it is 5.6 cases per 100,000women per year (with PTC being the main contributor to these differences) . This disproportion could be explained by several factors. In Italy, for example, neck US is widely used, with at least 6.9% of women and 4.6% of men undergoing annual examinations, partly due to the high prevalence ofmultinodular goitre (MNG)  in the context of a long- standing nationwide iodine de ﬁciency, which has only recently been addressed . In contrast, the Netherlands, with more adequate iodine coverage than Italy, presents a much lower prevalence of MNG . Moreover, in the Netherlands, routine US is not performed inasymptomatic patients with nodular thyroid diseases. Furthermore, since 2015, Dutch guidelines have sought to minimise the occurrence of clinically occult DTCdiagnosis by establishing stricter criteria for thyroid nodule investigations, recommending them solely for symptomatic nodules . Moreover, according to the same guidelines, incidental thyroid lesions detected byUS, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging should not be routinely investigated, given their low risk of malignancy. In addition, it wassuggested that the decision to perform ﬁne-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) should not be based on nodule US characteristics but rather on its dimensions(>1 cm) and clinical manifestations . Conversely, Italy mostly adheres to the European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines, which emphasise thenecessity for at least one evaluation of each (incidental) nodule. In addition, the US characteristics of the nodule should determine whether to proceed with FNAC . These contrasting diagnostic strategies, in addition toother potential contributing elements, may partly explain the signi ﬁcant discrepancies in TC incidencebetween these two countries. Moreover, they could result in different disease stages at presentation, different treatment strategies, and potentially differentoutcomes. Understanding how different diagnostic approaches in ﬂuence the treatment burden and outcome of patients in the real-life setting can helptailor widespread management recommendations. This study aims to compare disease presentation and outcomes between large DTC cohorts from two countries that differ strongly in terms of TC incidenceand diagnostic strategies. Methods Study design and population The study was conducted in accordance with the ethicalstandards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration. The Italian cohort includes patients enrolled in a clinical protocol(ClinicalTrials.gov identi ﬁer NCT05752604), while Dutch patients consented to the use of their anonymised clinical data for research purposes, with the study approved bythe Medical Ethics Review Committee East Netherlands (ﬁle number 2024-17318). Both centres are tertiary referral centres, recognised as Centres of Expertise forThyroid Carcinoma in their country. Data were retrospectively collected and analysed from medical records at both centres. A total of 919 DTC patients (586 from Istituto Auxologico Italiano (IAI) and 333 from Radboud University Medical Centre (RUMC))diagnosed between January 2016 and January 2024, with a follow-up (FU) of at least 6 months since primary treatment, were included. Patients withincomplete FU data were excluded. Clinical and pathological evaluation The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytology  was used to classify FNAC specimens. Operated patientswith a Bethesda 5 or 6 were considered as receiving ‘therapeutic surgery ’, while those with a Bethesda 3 or 4 were considered as receiving ‘diagnostic surgery ’. The detection of a DTC in a thyroid removed for other clinical reasons (e.g. MNG or Graves ’disease) was referred to as ‘incidental TC ’, and patients diagnosed via a biopsy/operation on a metastatic site of an initially unknown TC were referred to as ‘metastasis biopsy ’. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy (TT) or hemithyroidectomy (HT), besides a small proportionwho were considered inoperable at diagnosis because of the extent of the tumour. Lymphadenectomy was classi ﬁed following neck compartment involvement, thus being central (level VI), lateral (levels I –V), or central + lateral. Tumour staging followed the 8th edition of the AJCC staging system .D Ceruti et al. European Thyroid Journal  14e250161  Downloaded from Bioscientifica.com at 10/20/2025 10:04:45AM via Open Access.

Pathology reports were consulted for each patient to assess tumour size (cm), number of metastatic nodes, presence of extrathyroidal extension (ETE),multifocality, vascular invasion, and ATA risk strati ﬁcation . For a proportion of patients, primary treatment also included radioactive iodine (RAI) administration, eitherafter thyroid hormone withdrawal or after rhTSH stimulation. RAI was administered for ablative (1.1 GBq), adjuvant (3.7 GBq), or therapeutic (5.5 –7.4 GBq) purposes. Secondary treatment during FU consisted of one or more of the following: surgery for local and/or distant metastases, palliative/curative radiotherapy (RT), andtyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment. Patient risk of recurrence was assessed at the last FU visit according to dynamic risk strati ﬁcation (DRS), and patients were classi ﬁed as follows: excellent response (ER), indeterminate response (IR), biochemically incomplete response (BIR), and structurally incomplete response(SIR). DRS analysis was done according to the initialextent of primary treatment. ER was de ﬁned as follows: non-stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) level <0.2 ng/mL with undetectable anti-Tg antibodies (AbTg) and negativeimaging in case of total thyroidectomy ± RAI, or stable non-stimulated Tg level with undetectable anti-Tg and negative imaging in case of lobectomy. IR was de ﬁned as follows: non-stimulated Tg level 0.2 –1 ng/mL and/or stable/declining AbTg levels in case of total thyroidectomy + RAI, or non-stimulated Tg level0.2 –5 ng/mL and/or stable/declining AbTg levels in case of total thyroidectomy without RAI, or stable/declining AbTg levels in case of lobectomy; non-speci ﬁci m a g i n g ﬁndings also accounted for IR. BIR was de ﬁned as follows: non-stimulated Tg level >1 ng/mL and/or increasing AbTg levels in case of total thyroidectomy + RAI, or non-stimulated Tg level >5 ng/mL and/orincreasing AbTg levels in case of total thyroidectomy without RAI, or increasing Tg or AbTg levels in case of lobectomy; all the above in the absence of positiveimaging. SIR was de ﬁned by the presence of structural or functional evidence of disease, independent of the extent of initial treatment. Distant metastasis progression was assessed according to the RECIST Criteria v 1.1 , and DSS analysis included only TC-related deaths. Statistical analysis Results are expressed as the mean for normallydistributed continuous variables or as absolute frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.Comparison of continuous variables among the different groups was performed using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction for post hoc analysis.Categorical variables were compared by the χ2 test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. DSS and progression- free survival (PFS) analyses were performed using theKaplan –Meier method, and both populations were compared using the log-rank test. P< 0.05 was considered statistically signi ﬁcant. All analyses were carried out using SPSS Statistics for Windows (version 29.0). Results The differences in clinic opathological features, diagnostic and treatment modalities of the twocohorts are reported in Table 1 .T h eI A Ic o h o r t included a signi ﬁcantly lower proportion of male patients (27.1 vs 37.4%, P 0.001), and had a youngerage at diagnosis (48 ± 15.8 vs 53 ± 17.5 years, P<0 . 0 0 1 ) . The RUMC cohort showed a higher rate of follicular (FTC), oncocytic (OTC), and poorly differentiatedTC (PDTC), and a relatively lower proportion of PTC (P< 0.001). IAI cases were signi ﬁcantly more frequently small T1a/b tumours (69 vs 34%), while RUMC patientsshowed a higher rate of T2, T3a/b, T4a/b (T2-4, 66 vs 31%) and of lateral neck metastases (N1b, 33 vs 9%) (for both, P< 0.001). The Dutch cohort had a higher proportion of patients diagnosed with distantmetastases since diagnosis (18 vs 4%) and patients with stage III or IV disease (stage III –IV, 18 vs 3%) (for both, P< 0.001). The two cohorts showed a similar proportion of ETE (26 vs 29%, P=0 . 3 1 ) , multifocality (36 vs 31%, P= 0.15) and vascular invasion (24 vs 18%, P= 0.23). According to ATA risk strati ﬁcation, most IAI patients showed a low/intermediate risk (9 0 vs 53%) while high-risk patients represented up to half of the RUMC cohort(47 vs 10%) ( P<0 . 0 0 1 ) .A sf a ra st h ed i a g n o s t i c modalities are concerned, the two cohorts had similar proportions of therapeutic (57 vs 57%) and diagnostic surgeries (28 vs 24%). Differently, IAI hadmore ‘incidental DTC ’cases (18 vs 9%), while RUMC had more diagnoses based on the metastatic presentation of an initially unknown TC (6 vs 0.6%) ( P<0 . 0 0 1 ) . Concerning treatment modalities, the rates of TT and HT were similar in the two groups (TT: 87 vs 83%; HT; 13 vs 17%, P= 0.6), while the RUMC cohort showed a higher rate of inoperable disease (3.9 vs 0.3%, P<0 . 0 0 1 ) . Moreover, Dutch patients were more frequently treated with lateral neck dissection (33 vs 10%) andRAI therapy (79 vs 41%) (for both, P<0 . 0 0 1 ) .A m o n gt h e patients receiving RAI, the Dutch cohort was administered a higher cumulative dose (7.5 GBq vs 4.66 GBq, P< 0.001). Interestingly, the median number of cycles per patient was similar between the two groups (1.18 vs 1.27, P=0 . 1 2 ) ,b u tD u t c hp a t i e n t s were more frequently treated with 7.4 GBq as atherapeutic dose (61 vs 9%, P< 0.001). Additional treatments during FU were more frequently used in the RUMC cohort than in the IAI cohort: surgery forloco-regional disease control (16 vs 4%), radiotherapyin a palliative and/or curative setting (14 vs 0.8%), and TKI therapy (12 vs 3%) ( P<0 . 0 0 1 ) .D Ceruti et al.

ATA risk strati ﬁcation subanalysis Stratiﬁcation by ATA risk revealed differences in treatment strategies for patients with the same estimated risk of recurrence. Results are reported in Table 2 . ATA low-risk patients The IAI cohort showed higher rates of TT (84 vs 56%, P< 0.001), while neck dissection modalities and metastatic nodal involvement did not differ between the cohorts ( P= 0.41 and P= 0.58). Dutch patients received more RAI (44 vs 22%, P< 0.001) and achieved a higher ER rate (82 vs 67%, P= 0.01). No differences were found in secondary treatment modalities, and no progression or death events were observed in either cohort ( Fig. 1A and B ). ATA intermediate-risk patients In this subgroup, Dutch patients showed more N1b cases (32 vs 18%, P= 0.02) and received more TT (99 vs 92%, P= 0.03), RAI therapy (99 vs 68%, P< 0.001), subsequent surgeries (15 vs 6%, P= 0.02), and RT (4 vs 0%, P= 0.01).

However, IAI showed a higher rate of IR (22 vs 14%), while RUMC showed a higher rate ofSIR (25 vs 15%), thus resulting in a different response distribution between the two cohorts ( P< 0.001, Fig. 2 ). The RUMC cohort showed higher rates of distant metastatic progression (15.3 vs 3.7%, P< 0.001) with a relatively worse 5-year PFS (85 vs 96%, P< 0.001, χ 2= 39.2) (Fig. 3A ). TC-related mortality was 10% for the Dutch cohort and 1% for the Italian cohort, with a high 5-year DSS in both groups (IAI 99% vs RUMC 93%, P< 0.001, χ2= 44.3) ( Fig. 3B ). Discussion This study investigates two large cohorts of patients with DTC diagnosed after 2016 in two tertiary referral centres, from two European countries (Italy and the Netherlands) strongly differing in terms of TC incidence. On one hand, thelower incidence of DTC in the Netherlands is likely due tothe limited use of US for screening purposes and to an accurate selection of cases that are likely to be or become clinically meaningful and thus require treatment. On theother hand, in Italy, the wide use of thyroid US, only partially justi ﬁed by the high incidence of nodular goitre, is predicted to generate an overdiagnosis of a high numberof small and indolent DTC, which may increase the burden for patients and for the healthcare system. Thus, the analysis of the differences in both the clinicalpresentation and the outcome between an Italian and aDutch DTC cohort has great interest also in a socioeconomic setting.Interestingly, major differences in the clinical features at presentation between the two cohorts were found, withthe Dutch cohort showing a larger proportion of patientswith more advanced disease at diagnosis, in terms of both Figure 1 (A) Kaplan –Meier analysis for PFS in ATA low-risk patients; (B) Kaplan –Meier analysis for disease- speci ﬁc survival in ATA low-risk patients; (C) Kaplan –Meier analysis for PFS in ATA intermediate-risk patients; (D) Kaplan –Meier analysis for disease-speci ﬁc survival in ATA intermediate-risk patients; (E) Kaplan –Meier analysis for PFS in ATA high-risk patients; (F) Kaplan –Meier analysis for disease-speci ﬁc survival in ATA high-risk patients.

The data obtained in the Italian cohort are consistent with those reported in two studies based on the Italian Thyroid Cancer Observatory (ITCO) concerning both the rate of stage III and/or IV (3 and 5%,respectively) and that of ATA high-risk cases (10 and 8%, respectively) ( 15,16). On the other hand, in the RUMC Dutch series, the rate of stage III and/or IV waseven higher than that reported in the Netherlands Cancer Registry (18 vs 10%) (  ), whereas the percentage of ATA high-risk cases was similar to thatreported in another series from a Dutch academichospital (45 and 37%) . The latter data suggest that in the Netherlands, there is a selection towards more advanced cases being referred to academic hospitals.Therefore, the Dutch cohort is likely representative of the patient population treated in tertiary referral centres in the Netherlands but may not accurately re ﬂect the general DTC patient population in that country. Nevertheless, because the proportion of patients with stages III-IV in the Netherlands Cancer Registrysurpasses the proportion found in the Italian cohort, itis most likely that also at a nationwide level, a larger proportion of patients diagnosed with DTC in the Netherlands have more advanced disease atpresentation than those diagnosed in Italy.Interestingly, similar data have also been reported in a recent study comparing the DTC presentation in two cohorts from a Dutch and a German university hospital. The authors found that lymph node metastases were signiﬁcantly more frequently present in PTC tumours ≤1 cm and distant metastases in tumours ≤2c mi n patients with restrictive use of US for thyroid screening(the Netherlands) when compared to those from a country with ubiquitous availability of thyroid US screening (Germany). In the present study, we accurately evaluated possible differences in the treatment modalities and found that the Dutch cohort received RAI therapy more frequently(and at a higher cumulative activity), second surgeries during FU, and RT for palliative or curative purposes. These results were likely in ﬂuenced not only by the tumour presentation at diagnosis but also by different protocols followed in the two centres. For RAI treatment indications, RUMC mostly relied on the 2016 ATAguidelines , thus administering RAI treatment in all high-risk and in a high proportion of intermediate-risk patients. In contrast, in the IAI cohort, RAI treatment is guided by tumour markers (thyroglobulin and/orthyroglobulin antibodies) and post-operative US ﬁndings . Likewise, the higher prevalence in the RUMC cohort of second surgeries and RT is based on adifferent approach to disease persistence/recurrence, which is not addressed by current guidelines, as it is not supported by strong evidence and is based on acase-by-case deliberation with the multidisciplinary team and in a shared-decision process together with the patient. In particular, the above-mentionedmultidisciplinary team is composed of anendocrinologist, oncologist, thyroid surgeon, nuclear medicine doctor and, if needed, radiotherapist. Differently, most Italian cases were treated accordingto the endocrinologist ’s indication, with the most challenging ones referred for multidisciplinary evaluation. Moreover, in the Italian cohort, activesurveillance is frequently chosen for stable small metastatic nodal disease , while in the RUMC cohort, radicality and a curative approach tend to bemore frequently sought. For both cohorts, TKIstreatment was chosen only for progressive metastatic RAI-refractory disease : the higher use of TKIs in the Dutch cohort re ﬂects the higher number of progressive metastatic cases with a more advanced clinical presentation at diagnosis. The Dutch cohort had a signi ﬁcantly worse 5-year PFS, and TC-related mortality was 10% for the Dutch cohort and 1% for the Italian cohort, likely related to the higher proportion of patients with advanced disease atpresentation in the Dutch cohort. These data are consistent with those found in the Dutch and German cohorts mentioned above, with a TC-related mortality of6.5 and 0.9%, respectively . It is worth noting that the worse PFS and DSS found for the Dutch cohort are also consistent with the higher degree of case selection in the Figure 3 (A) Kaplan –Meier analysis for PFS; (B) Kaplan –Meier analysis for disease-speci ﬁc survival.

Netherlands, where more advanced patients are referred to tertiary care hospitals, and more indolent cases are also treated in peripheral hospitals. Importantly, it shouldbe underlined that the survival outcomes are still excellent for both cohorts, highlighting that DTC remains ef ﬁciently manageable also in more advanced forms. An interesting and original ﬁnding of the present paper is the evaluation of the two cohorts according to the ATArisk classi ﬁcation. This subanalysis highlighted interesting differences mostly related to the treatment strategies between the two centres in patients with anestimated similar risk of recurrence. Particularly, in theATA low-risk cases, TT was signi ﬁcantly more frequent than HT in the Italian centre, re ﬂecting the higher prevalence of incidental cases found during surgeriesplanned for benign nodular diseases. On the other hand, RAI residue ablation was signi ﬁcantly more frequent in the Dutch cohort, and this resulted in ahigher prevalence of ERs in this cohort. No impact on PFS and DSS was observed in this low-risk category, conﬁrming that a less aggressive approach can be safely adopted as suggested in the ATA guidelines . RAI, external radiotherapy and second surgery were also signi ﬁcantly more frequently used in the Dutch cohort for the ATA intermediate-risk category, and ahigher frequency of ERs was recorded, without differences in the progression or survival outcome. Finally, in the ATA high-risk category, the lateral neckcompartment was signi ﬁcantly more frequently dissected in the Dutch cohort, as well as RAI treatment and external radiotherapy, while TKI treatment was started in 20 –25% of cases in both groups. Inoperable cases represented 3% of the Italian high-risk patients and 8% of the Dutch high- risk patients. PFS and DSS did not signi ﬁcantly differ between the two cohorts of high-risk patients. Study limitations This study has certain limitations that must be acknowledged. First, the academic setting of the research may limit the generalisability of the ﬁndings to the broader national population. Nevertheless, the series are large enough to ensure a reliable statistical analysis for referral centres. Second, we did not include inour comparative analyses the tumour genetic pattern,and the possibility that one cohort would be enriched by more aggressive mutations cannot be discarded. On the other hand, genetic data were available in a minorityof cases, and the whole genetic characterisation of these two large series goes beyond the scope of the study. Furthermore, the different cultural approaches to theprevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases between these two countries have not been considered. Finally, a cost-effectiveness analysis should have beencarried out to evaluate the impact of bothoverdiagnosis and diagnosis in a more advanced stage on national health systems, but this evaluation ischallenging because of the two profoundly different health systems involved (public in Italy and insurance-based in the Netherlands). Conclusion Data reported in the present comparison between twoEuropean countries highlight the impact of diagnosticpractices on the different prevalence of TC and the role of US in the overdiagnosis. On the other hand, the earlier diagnosis inevitably leads to a better presentation and asigniﬁcantly higher PFS and DSS, though the rate of cured patients remains high, likely due to the more aggressivetherapeutic strategies applied in the Dutch cohort and tothe low aggressiveness of the majority of TCs. Finally, ourdata demonstrate that caution should be exercised whenanalysing TC prevalence and outcome in differentEuropean countries, since relevant differences exist,likely due to variabilities in either healthcare systems,iodine nutritional status, or diagnostic and treatmentapproaches.
