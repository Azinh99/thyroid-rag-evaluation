Highlights of the NCCN 18th Annual Conference © JNCCN—Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | Volume 11 Number 5.5 | May 2013705 Abstract Thyroid cancer is common but rarely deadly. Unfortunately, when the disease becomes refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI), few ef - fective treatment options remain. This situation is changing, how - ever, with the availability of multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibi - tors. Cabozantanib and vandetanib, both recently FDA-approved for advanced or metastatic disease, have more than doubled pro - gression-free survival in medullary thyroid cancer. New agents in the pipeline may yield even better outcomes, as discussed by Dr. Robert I. Haddad at the NCCN 18th Annual Conference. ( JNCCN 2013;11:705–707) “These are exciting times in thyroid cancer. T wo new drugs have become available for advanced medullary thyroid cancer, and more are expected in the next few years,” said Robert I. Haddad, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Disease Center Leader of the Head and Neck Oncology Pro - gram at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston. Thyroid cancer is not rare: more than 60,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States and the numbers are rising, probably due to better diagno - sis. Thyroid cancer deaths, however, are rare, with only about 1800 a year despite the high cancer incidence, Dr. Haddad added. Most cases of thyroid cancer are dif - ferentiated thyroid cancers (83% papillary, 11% follicu -New Developments in Thyroid Cancer Presented by Robert I. Haddad, MD lar). The more aggressive anaplastic and medullary car - cinomas comprise 3.3%, and 2% are other subtypes.1 All histologic subtypes are poorly responsive to chemother - apy, and patients with advanced disease that becomes refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI) have had few treatment options, although this picture is changing. RAI-refractory distant metastases are associated with a median survival of 3 to 6 years. Oncogenic muta - tions in BRAF and RAS are associated with worse pro - gression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Expert consensus and the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) recom - mend clinical trials for patients with progressive meta - static disease; if access is unavailable, the anti-angio - genic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can be used. The Role for TKIs The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) path - way is important in thyroid cancer, and various tyro - sine kinases are activated in the disease. Thus, there is a therapeutic role for multikinase inhibitors. In a phase II trial of pazopanib in 39 patients with rapidly progressive RAI-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, the response rate was 49% and the likelihood of response lasting longer than 1 year was estimated at 66%.2 In a phase II study of sorafenib, 30 patients were treated for a minimum of 16 weeks, after which 23% showed response and 53% showed stable disease lasting 14 to more than 80 weeks. Median PFS was 79 weeks.3 “I have used sorafenib extensively, and I can say that some patients do benefit,” Dr. Haddad commented. A phase III trial has been completed, but the data are not yet available. Dr. Haddad cautioned that although TKIs can be ef - fective in thyroid cancer, many patients with metastatic Presented by Robert I.

In a study recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine , the MEK1/MEK2 in - hibitor selumetinib induced iodine incorporation in patients with BRAF- mutations.6 After stimulation with thyrotropin alfa, dosim - etry with iodine-124 PET was performed before and 4 weeks after treatment with selumetinib. If the sec - ond PET indicated that a 2000 cGy or higher dose of iodine-131 could be delivered to the metastatic lesion, therapeutic RAI was given with selumetinib. Among the 20 evaluable patients, selumetinib in - creased the uptake of iodine in 12, and 8 of these reached the dosimetry threshold for RAI therapy. “Selumetinib-induced iodine incorporation in RAI-refractory thyroid tumors translated to a thera - peutic response with RAI,” he noted. Patients with RAS mutations may be particularly susceptible to this strategy. Medullary Thyroid Cancer Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) accounts for 5% to 8% of thyroid cancers. Patients with distant metas - tases have a median survival of about 2 years. About three-quarters of cases occur sporadically, typically in the fifth or sixth decade, while 25% are hereditary. Somatic RET mutations are present in up to 65% of disease do not require treatment for many years after the diagnosis of metastases. The drugs have side ef - fects that impact quality of life without necessarily prolonging survival; therefore, care should be taken in starting treatment, he said. Another agent that showed promising activity in thyroid cancer is lenvatinib or E7080. In a 58-patient study, a 41% response rate was seen among patients with previous VEGF-targeted treatment and a 54% response rate was seen in TKI-naïve patients. Stable disease was seen in 53% and 42%, respectively.4 Medi - an time to response was 2.1 months, and median PFS was 13.3 months. Treatment-related adverse events were primarily hypertension , diarrhea and proteinuria (grade 3 in 10%). The phase III trial of lenvatinib is now complete, but data are unavailable. MEK Inhibitors Show Encouraging Activity RAI resistance means that RAI fails to incorporate into metastatic sites, and this resistance is associated with higher mortality. Preclinical studies have shown that pharmacologic inhibition of oncogenic BRAF signaling increases RAI incorporation.5 Recent stud - ies suggest that MEK inhibitors might be capable of reversing RAI resistance and making RAI avid and P <.0001 219 121 78 55 31 12 2 1 111 35 11 6 3 2 0 0 Cabozantinib Placebo Subjects at risk: 0 234567800.3 0.10.20.5 0.40.6Probability 1 9101112131415161718192021220.70.80.91.0Cabozantinib Placebo Median PFS 11.2 4.0 (mo) 1 year PFS 47.3% 7.2% HR (95% CI) 0.28 (0.19, 0.40) Months Figure 1 Progression free survival (PFS; primary endpoint).

Hepatocyte growth factor receptor and VEGF receptor 2 pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MTC. T wo drugs were recently approved for metastatic MTC: cabozantinib  and vandetanib . The NCCN Guidelines list both drugs as category 1 treatments for unresectable disease that is symptomat - ic or asymptomatic and structurally progressive. In the phase III EXAM trial, 330 patients (75% treatment- naïve) were randomized to receive cabozantinib 140 mg daily or placebo.7 Median PFS was 11.2 months with cabozantinib versus 4.0 months for placebo; 1-year PFS was 47.3% versus 7.2%; and the hazard ra - tio was highly significant at 0.28 (P <.0001; Figure 1). All subgroups appeared to benefit from cabozantinib. The final OS analysis is not available yet. In the phase III ZETA trial involving 331 pa - tients, vandetanib similarly showed a highly signifi - cant difference in PFS (hazard ratio 0.46; P <.0001).8 Responses were seen in 45% of patients receiving vandetanib versus 13% with placebo ( P <.0001). Al - most all responses in the placebo arm occurred while patients were receiving vandetanib. Median dura - tion of response had not been reached at 24 months of follow-up. Additionally, significant reductions in calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen were ob - served, with odds ratios for biochemical responses of 73 and 52, respectively, in the study ( P <.0001). “I have used vandetanib extensively, because it has been available longer than cabozantinib, and I have seen significant and durable responses and marked re - ductions in biomarker levels,” Dr. Haddad noted. But cabozantinib and vandetanib are not with - out side effects, and doses may need to be reduced, he cautioned. In both the EXAM and ZETA trials, dose reductions were necessary in most patients. Vandetanib can prolong the QT interval, and cases of Torsades de pointes and sudden death were re - ported in clinical trials. Because of this risk, the drug is available only through the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program. The most ef - fective cardiac monitoring is with EKG, not echo - cardiogram. More commonly, diarrhea, rash, and fa - tigue are reported. “Be careful with the 300 mg dose of vandetanib, and be prepared to dose-reduce,” Dr. Haddad advised. Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Anaplastic thyroid cancer is the most aggressive and lethal histologic subtype. Treatment must be started immediately, and resection is recommended, even for palliation. Chemotherapy is generally ineffec - tive, but it can be considered after surgery in select patients. Dr. Haddad noted, “we routinely use con - current chemoradiotherapy in patients who under - go a complete surgical resection and our preferred regimen is weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel. Refer these patients immediately for a clinical trial if one is available. This is one of the most aggressive and lethal cancers in humans,” Dr. Haddad emphasized.
